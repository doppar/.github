## Why Doppar?

Doppar is engineered for speed. With minimal reliance on third-party libraries and most features built directly into the core, you get lightning-fast performance right out of the box. No unnecessary bloatâ€”just clean, efficient execution. Doppar ORM Built entirely from core with zero external dependencies, Doppar delivers a powerful and expressive ORM system. Manage complex relationships with easeâ€”no third-party packages required. Whether you're a seasoned PHP developer or just diving in, Doppar makes it easy to build powerful applications quickly and cleanly.

We just put Doppar to the test under some serious load â€” and the results are in:

### Doppar Performance Benchmark

**Objective:** Compare request handling and latency of Doppar under high concurrency with a database-backed endpoint.

- **Load:** 50,000 requests
- **Concurrency:** 1,000 simultaneous requests
- **Endpoint:** `/tags` (database-backed endpoint to fetch `tags`)
- **Tool:** ApacheBench (ab)
- **Metrics Measured:** Requests per second, median/percentile latency, max latency, response size, failed requests

| Metric              | **Doppar**       |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Total Requests**  | 50,000           |
| **Failed Requests** | 0                |
| **Requests/sec**    | **318.5 req/s**  |
| **Median Latency**  | \~2.7s (2703 ms) |
| **95th Percentile** | \~4.8s           |
| **Max Latency**     | \~7.9s           |
| **Response Size**   | 1083 bytes       |

### What This Means
-  **High Throughput:** Doppar consistently handled over 318 requests per second under 1,000 concurrent users.
-  **Low Latency Under Load:** Median latency stayed under 3 seconds, even when stressed with database-backed queries.
-  **Rock-Solid Stability:** Zero failed requests across 50,000 test runs..

### Why Doppar Stands Out

Handling `1,000 concurrent` connections and tens of thousands of requests isnâ€™t easy. Even the most popular PHP frameworks slow down dramatically in these conditions â€” but Doppar was designed from the ground up for concurrency, efficiency, and resilience.

### Doppar delivers:

- ~7â€“8Ã— more throughput compared to what typical PHP frameworks achieve in similar tests.
- Predictable latency, ensuring user experience stays responsive at scale.
- Optimized database interaction, making Doppar ideal for data-heavy applications.

ðŸ‘‰ If youâ€™re building systems that demand real scalability, high concurrency, and reliable performance, Doppar is ready to power them.

### Key highlights:

- **Simplicity with Power** Intuitive architecture that stays out of your way.
- **Feature-Based Development** Organize your application by features, not layers.
- **Just-in-Time (JIT)** Advanced JIT compilation for the Blade template engine.
- **Performance First** Lightweight and efficient, designed for speed without compromise.
- **Scalable & Modular** Perfect for projects of all sizesâ€”from microservices to full-scale.
- **API Presenter Bundle** Fully internal, zero-config API Presenter. no overrides required.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (TOTP)** Industry-standard TOTP Authentication.
- **Rich Ecosystem** Eloquent ORM, Routing, Middleware, Pool Console, Caching and more.
- **Developer-Focused** Simplifies development with thoughtful conventions.
